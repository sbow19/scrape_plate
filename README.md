# Scrape Plate 

Custom scraping tool for static and dynamic web-sites. Define how to scrape a web page once.

## About

You define schemas for the information you want to capture on a given page. Every time you navigate to a page where you have a schema defined, you can automatically scrape the contents of that page according to a set schema for that page.

The objective of this application is to free up the time spent on capturing information from various open source information repositories, especially dynamically-generated repositories that are not easy to scrape with automated methods.

**Use cases:** 
- Company information repositories
- Frequently visited target websites
- Populating table and report templates with project data

This app is also intended to give you the flexibility to group data into projects, assign scraped data tags (such as time stamps), and allow the user the visualise changes to data over time.

This application was conceived by an experienced open source intelligence researcher who found the constant trips to sites to gather 
structured company information to be repetitive, prone to error, and boring.

## Installation

The application will be available on the Chrome Web Store, however anyone who is interested contributing to the project may download the source code and current public build here.

## Usage

More to come soon.
